BUGZY.TXT Command Line Interface
================================

A simple (and not yet extensible) shell script for managing bugs/features/enhancements and tasks.

Bugs have a unique persistent serial number. Each bug is written to a separate file with various fields
in the email header like format with title, description, severity, date_created, type, fix, comments,
log, status, etc.
